# GPT-DriveBus

## Project Overview

GPT-DriveBus utilizes GPT-3.5 to drive the development of a cognitive model that emulates bus driving behavior through interaction with a simulation environment. This model leverages prompt engineering and human-in-the-loop methodologies to achieve a realistic and dynamic motor behavior representation.

## Use

1: With prompt, you need to input the simulation environment link into GPT 3.5 with a description of the task https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/638110/

2: You need Emacs and Lisp Slime to run the finished ACT-R model

3: You need to download ACT-R 7.27.9 http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/software/ for execution

## Models Explanation

1: The models are being built by ChatGPT 3.5 with Humans in the loop debugging

2: You should take a look at the phase 1 and 2 models to understand the iterative developing process and run phase three to evaluate the model's performance.
